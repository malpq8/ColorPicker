# ColorPicker
Description: Create an iOS app that contains a Picker View that lists the colors Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple. When the app launches, the picker is to be set to one of the colors, the background color of the view is to be the selected color and the label in the view is to display the name of the color. When the user selects another color using the picker, the background color is to be set to the selected color and the name of the color is to be displayed in the label. In the viewDidLoad, set the initial color to the first color (Red) in the array of colors. Make sure, though, that the initial color can be set to any of the colors in the array. Do not hard-code the initial background color or the initial string in the label. A variable should indicate the index of the initial color and the code should use the initial color to set the background color, string in the label, and the selection on the picker.
